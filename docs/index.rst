Welcome to CerebUnit's documentation!
==================================================

CerebUnit is one of the four components for validating cerebellum models: two being `CerebModels <https://github.com/cerebunit/cerebmodels>`_ and `CerebData <https://github.com/cerebunit/cerebdata>`_, which does not require installation while `CerebStats <https://github.com/cerebunit/cerebstats>`_ and CerebUnit require installation.

This is the documentation for the **CerebTests** component.
